# fast-api-quickstart
Course administration API using FastAPI and MongoDB

This is a development environment that can be used to build a FastAPI backend that defines API endpoints. The endpoints are for obtaining course data and adding chapter ratings. 
The test_app.py includes tests to verify the status codes, data presence, sorting order, and domain filtering in the API responses.
